# Page List Image Label

This module enables you to add thumbnails of images from the pages in the admin page tree.

After installing you can define some options if you like to specify a width/height of the thumbnails and also change the look with some css options, like border padding and background color.

## How to use
All you need to do to enable it, is add the name (i.e. images) of the image field you have on the template to the custom label option in the advanced template settings.

It works for single, multiple and cropimage image field types. If multiple images field it will always take the first image from the stack.
